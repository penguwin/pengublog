[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is an open source static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org) which also claims
to be the fastest framework for building websites. With Hugo you can write
your posts in the [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) markup language and most configuration happens
inside a [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file. It's simple to setup with just a couple of steps needed
and can be configured to match your wishes.
So let's give it a go :)


## Installation {#installation}

Hugo is commonly included by package managers - which I personally prefer
to use - but can also be installed via the repository.

Assumed you have a working [Go](https://golang.org) installation you can simply run following
commands and let the magic happen:

<a id="code-snippet--hugo-installation"></a>
```shell
go get -v -u github.com/gohugoio/hugo
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/gohugoio/hugo
go install -v
```

After this Hugo should be installed on your system.

<a id="code-snippet--which-hugo"></a>
```shell
which hugo
```

```text
/home/penguwin/code/golang/bin/hugo
```

Now after we've installed the software we can start creating a new blog and
configure it's contents.


## Creating the blog {#creating-the-blog}

At first head into the folder where you locally want to store your blog
with it's files. There you can run following command to let hugo create a
sites skeleton with your desired name.

<a id="code-snippet--hugo-create-blog"></a>
```shell
hugo new site pengublog
```

Following message should be printed out after creation:

```text
Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /home/penguwin/Nextcloud/projects/pengublog.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/, or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>/<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.
```

Now we have the basic structure for your site but we still need to tweak
it a little bit more. As we can see in the upper message we still need to
add a Theme and some content.


## Choosing a theme {#choosing-a-theme}

There's a wide variety of free and open source [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io) which can be used
for your blog. For this example I've choosen a clean and simple theme
called **finite** from the Hugo themes showcase.

Themes are added as git submodule. Head into your newly created folder and
hit following:

<a id="code-snippet--clone-theme"></a>
```shell
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/lambdafu/hugo-finite themes/finite
```

```text
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/penguwin/Nextcloud/projects/pengublog/.git/
```

You'll now be able to find the designs in the '/themes' folder. To
actually use it with Hugo you still need to declare it in your
**config.toml** file.

<a id="code-snippet--use-theme"></a>
```shell
echo 'theme = "finite"' >> config.toml
```


## Writing blog posts {#writing-blog-posts}

In order two have a nice blog, you need to add some content. With hugo
creating a post is also quite easy:

<a id="code-snippet--hugo-create-post"></a>
```shell
hugo new post/my-first-post.md
```

```text
/home/penguwin/Nextcloud/projects/pengublog/content/posts/my-first-post.md created
```

Now you can edit the markdown files content laying in `content/post/` as
you desire.


## Starting the hugo server {#starting-the-hugo-server}

Now we finally want to see our blog in action. To start the server with
drafts enabled you'll need following command:

<a id="code-snippet--starting-hugo-server"></a>
```shell
hugo server -D
```

If everything works out a message like this should be printed out.

```text

```

As we can see the server waits at your [localhost](https://localhost:1313) and will live-reload as
soon as you edit the content of the blogs configs or markdown posts.


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Getting started with Hugo is super easy and you can create a nice blog from
zero to ready-to-go in just a couple of commands.
There's still some work needed in order to publicate the blog into the wild
internet and of course we still have to personalize the blog with posts and
information about the author before we deploy it online.
For these further steps I can recommend reading the docs online as Hugo is
well documented and actively developed by a nice community.
